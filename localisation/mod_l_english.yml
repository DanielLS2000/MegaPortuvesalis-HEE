 flavor_akd.1.t:0 "The Bitlis Observatory"
 flavor_akd.1.d:0 "The Bitlis Observatory traces its origins back to the 13th century, during the height of the mighty Akkad. It was commissioned by the illustrious Akkadian ruler, Ea-Nasir, as a symbol of his commitment to advancing the realm of science and unraveling the secrets of the cosmos. Guided by the genius of Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, an esteemed polymath and astronomer, the observatory became a haven for scholars from far and wide. However, the ravages of time and the ebb and flow of empires conspired to cast a shadow over this beacon of knowledge. Neglect and conflict marred its once-majestic halls, leaving it a mere shadow of its former glory. But fret not, for our enlightened reign shall herald a renaissance for the Bitlis Observatory. Under our guidance, the observatory will be meticulously restored to its former grandeur. Walls once worn by centuries of neglect shall be repaired, and the celestial instruments that once guided the gaze of scholars shall be revived. A select group of astronomers, mathematicians, and cartographers will be invited from across our realm to revive the spirit of inquiry that once thrived within these walls. The restored Maragheh Observatory shall serve as a center of astronomical research and intellectual discourse, attracting brilliant minds from far and wide. Our kingdom will bask in the glory of their discoveries, as they unravel the mysteries of the cosmos and illuminate the darkest corners of the night sky. The knowledge gleaned within these halls shall not only enrich our realm's scientific pursuits but also strengthen our position as patrons of learning and enlightenment."

However, years of conflict and neglect have seen this once-grand mausoleum fall into a state of decay. Recently, a resurgence of cultural pride and a desire to commemorate our heritage has led to calls for the restoration of the Mausoleum. Such a monumental effort could invigorate our people, demonstrating our commitment to honoring our past and preserving our legacy. But it also requires a considerable allocation of resources. Should we allocate funds and manpower to restore this monument to its former glory, or should we focus our attention on more pressing matters?"
