 aurelian_monarchy_reform: "Aurelian Monarchy"

 regional_governors_system: "Regional Governors System"
 regional_governors_system_desc: "The Regional Governors System, implemented in 1460, marked a critical turning point in the reorganization of Italy after the turbulent Century of Campanilismo. Inspired by the need to balance local autonomy with centralized authority, the system divided the Italian peninsula into self-governed regions under governors who answered directly to the monarch. This reform drew lessons from the successes and failures of previous rulers, particularly Eleonora the Great and Emanuel von Klautz, and echoed contemporary governance philosophies. The reform aimed to stabilize Italy’s fragmented political landscape by empowering regional leaders with administrative, economic, and military oversight while ensuring loyalty to the central throne. Governors, chosen for their merit and commitment to the crown, managed local affairs, collected taxes, and coordinated regional defense. This structure allowed the monarchy to focus on broader national goals, such as economic revitalization and diplomatic alliances.The system's design bore striking similarities to the modern governance model seen in Minas Gerais, Brazil, under Governor Romeu Zema. Much like Zema’s emphasis on efficiency, fiscal responsibility, and decentralization to promote regional development, the Regional Governors System emphasized the pragmatic delegation of power to foster unity and prosperity across Italy. By balancing local needs with national interests, the system successfully mitigated regional rivalries, paving the way for a more cohesive and progressive Italy."
