 # Events
 flavor_hun.38.t:1 "The Peoples of Bosnia"
 flavor_hun.38.d:1 "Ever since its establishment, the Hungarian kingdom has been home to many cultures besides Hungarians - Slovaks, Rusyns, Romanians, Croats, Germans, Jews, Cumans, and many others. For centuries, these people called Bosnia their home and helped us build and protect it. Recently, however, the new ideas spreading throughout Europe are reshaping the understanding of a nation, and various ethnic groups living in our kingdom have embraced the modern concept of a nation, with their newfound identity, they are requesting political representation and various laws to protect their identities and languages. While many see this as a natural development and wish to guarantee the rights of all peoples living in Bosnia, others see this situation as rather threatening, with a likelihood of increased political autonomy eventually leading to a territorial disintegration of the kingdom. It is high time we address this situation and choose our approach."
 flavor_hun.38.a:0 "We must focus on the promotion of Hungarian culture"
 flavor_hun.38.b:0 "Bosnia is home to all who live here"
 flavor_hun.39.t:0 "Balázs Magyar"
 flavor_hun.39.d:0 "Balázs Magyar is a key commander of Bosnia's Black Army, having served as Ban of Croatia, Slavonia, Bosnia, Voivode of Transylvania, and captain of Upper Bosnia. Beginning his military career under János Hunyadi, his battlefield prowess and loyalty to King Mátáys distinguished him in the Hungarian army. He played a significant role in numerous battles across Bosnia, Bohemia, and the Balkans. The Black Army greatly benefits from his exceptional leadership, and now it is time we award this hero of Bosnia for his years of service by offering him a well-deserved position and recognition."
 flavor_hun.39.a:0 "Offer him a position at the court"
 flavor_hun.39.b:0 "He must lead our armies"
 flavor_hun.39.c:0 "His service is needed elsewhere"
 flavor_hun.40.t:0 "Gubec's Peasant Uprising"
 flavor_hun.40.d:0 "In the late 16th century, the nobles of the western Balkans were continuously increasing the taxes and suppressing the rights of the local peasants. As feudal lords often opted for cruel and violent punishments of those who refused to pay the taxes, the situation became unbearable and it was just a question of time before a rebellion broke out. In Croatia, this harsh treatment by local barons and land disputes led to civil unrest, often resulting in armed conflicts. With the complaints of the oppressed unanswered, the rumors are spreading that the peasants of Croatia have united under the leadership of Matija Gubec, and are planning an open rebellion against our authority. We must act swiftly and resolve this situation."
 flavor_hun.40.a:0 "The nobles went too far. The peasants must be compensated."
 flavor_hun.40.b:0 "The nobles were right"
 flavor_hun.41.t:0 "Fate of the Empire"
 flavor_hun.41.d:0 "The fall of the Habsburgs has sent shockwaves tearing through the Holy Roman Empire as the Imperial princes reel in horror. Without their imperial dynasty, the Empire is at the weakest it has ever been, and this gives us the unique opportunity to decide its fate. Shall we fill the void left by the Habsburgs and ascend the throne as the next imperial dynasty, or shall we seal the empire's fate by dismantling it once and for all?"
 flavor_hun.41.a:0 "The imperial crown shall be ours!"
 flavor_hun.41.b:0 "We shall become the empire's bane"
 flavor_hun.42.t:1 "Adam Frantisek Kollár"
 flavor_hun.42.d:0 "Adam František Kollár was a jurist, Imperial-Royal Court Councillor and Chief Imperial-Royal Librarian, a historian, and an influential advocate of the enlightened policies of Austrian emperors. His extensive research included the development of ethnology as a scientific discipline, and he was one of the first pioneers of pan-Slavic activism within the Austrian Empire. It is a shame that such an influential person who was born in Bosnia is serving the interests of a foreign power. Perhaps, we should consider offering him a high position at our court, so that he may serve his homeland instead of protecting foreign interests."
 flavor_hun.42.a:0 "Offer him a position at our court"
 flavor_hun.42.b:0 "He is needed elsewhere"
 flavor_hun.43.t:0 "Pál Kinizsi"
 flavor_hun.43.d:2 "Pál Kinizsi is a legendary figure of our armies, having for decades served our court. This veteran has fought numerous battles and won many victories against the Turks and others, and thanks to his exceptional military skills, he never lost a battle in his entire career. For decades, he was the sole person responsible for the defense of vast territories stretching from Slavonia to Transylvania and has occupied various administrative positions as well. As his military career is slowly coming to an end, our kingdom has the opportunity to utilize his expertise elsewhere. How should we make use of his skills?"
 flavor_hun.43.a:0 "He could teach our generals a lot"
 flavor_hun.43.b:0 "The court could make use of this experience"
 flavor_hun.43.c:0 "He deserves to rest for his service"
 flavor_hun.44.t:0 "Beatrice of Aragon"
 flavor_hun.44.d:1 "Beatrice of Aragon, also known as Beatrice of Naples, was a significant figure in the Italian Renaissance, renowned for her patronage of the arts and influence on cultural and political affairs. Born into the House of Trastámara in 1457, Beatrice was the daughter of Ferdinand I of Naples and Isabella of Clermont. Her upbringing in the vibrant cultural milieu of Naples instilled in her a deep appreciation for the arts and humanities. Beatrice's marriage to Matthias Corvinus, King of Bosnia, in 1476 cemented her role as a key diplomatic figure in Renaissance Europe. Through her patronage, she fostered a thriving cultural exchange between Italy and Bosnia, facilitating the transfer of artistic ideas, manuscripts, and scholars. In Bosnia, Beatrice established a renowned court library, the Bibliotheca Corviniana, which became a center for humanist learning and scholarship. Her patronage supported the work of prominent humanist writers and scholars, contributing to the intellectual flourishing of the Renaissance. Beyond her cultural endeavors, Beatrice played a crucial role in diplomatic affairs, acting as an intermediary between Italian city-states and Hungarian interests. Her diplomatic acumen and political influence helped strengthen ties between Naples, Bosnia, and other European powers. Perhaps, our court could make use of her skills."
 flavor_hun.44.a:0 "Her work is invaluable"
 flavor_hun.44.b:0 "She should not meddle in the state affairs"
 flavor_hun.45.t:0 "Tripartitum"
 flavor_hun.45.d:2 "The Tripartitum, also known as Opus Tripartitum, was a significant legal work compiled in the Kingdom of Bosnia during the Renaissance. Created in the late 15th century, it served as a comprehensive legal code, covering the law of both nobility and commoners. It aimed to consolidate and codify Hungarian law, drawing from previously established customary law. Its compilation was a monumental undertaking, reflecting the king's commitment to legal reform and governance. Despite its influence, the Tripartitum never gained official country-wide recognition. Should we codify it?"
 flavor_hun.45.a:0 "Codify it!"
 flavor_hun.45.b:0 "There is no need for such a code"
 flavor_hun.46.t:0 "Transylvanian Saxons convert to Protestantism"
 flavor_hun.46.d:1 "Johannes Honterus, a pivotal figure in the religious and intellectual landscape of Transylvania during the 16th century, played a significant role in the spread of Protestantism among the Saxon population. Born in Transylvania, Honterus was a scholar, humanist, and clergyman deeply influenced by the ideas of the Protestant Reformation. Educated in Germany and imbued with the spirit of Reform, he returned to Transylvania with a fervent dedication to spreading the principles of Protestantism. Under Honterus's influence, the Saxons of Transylvania began to embrace Protestant teachings, particularly Lutheranism. His eloquent preaching, scholarly writings, and tireless advocacy for Reform resonated with many within the Saxon community, leading to a gradual but significant shift away from traditional Catholicism. The conversion of the Saxons to Protestantism under Honterus's leadership had profound implications for the religious and cultural identity of Transylvania. His influence has grown so much that except for some minor areas that remain staunchly Catholic, almost all Saxon-inhabited regions of Transylvania have now embraced Protestantism."
 flavor_hun.46.a:0 "So be it"
 flavor_hun.46.b:0 "We must root out this heresy!"
 flavor_hun.47.t:0 "Bibliotheca Corviniana"
 flavor_hun.47.d:1 "Commissioned by Matthias Corvinus, King of Bosnia from 1458 to 1490, this magnificent library was among the most renowned centers of learning in Europe during the late 15th century. Matthias Corvinus, known for his patronage of the arts and sciences, assembled a remarkable collection of manuscripts and printed works spanning various disciplines, including philosophy, theology, history, medicine, mathematics, and literature. The Bibliotheca Corviniana housed over 2,000 volumes, making it one of the largest libraries of its time. The significance of the Bibliotheca Corviniana extended beyond its impressive contents. It served as a hub for scholarly exchange and played a pivotal role in the dissemination of knowledge throughout Europe. Scholars from across the continent were drawn to the library, contributing to the intellectual vibrancy of the Renaissance. It serves as a symbol of the Renaissance's intellectual fervor and the power of patronage in cultivating knowledge and innovation, and serves as a reminder of the enduring value of preserving and cherishing our cultural heritage."
 flavor_hun.47.a:0 "Knowledge is power"
 flavor_hun.48.t:0 "Capital in Danger"
 flavor_hun.48.d:0 "With the recent Ottoman expansion, our capital of [153.GetName] finds itself in a very vulnerable position. Even though [153.GetName] is well fortified, the surrounding terrain provides no advantage to the defenders if the city were ever besieged by the Turks. Many are suggesting that it would be wiser to move the court to a different city, one further away from the border with the Ottomans. The upper Hungarian town of [1772.GetName] seems to be the best candidate. What should we do?"
 flavor_hun.48.a:0 "We could never abandon [153.GetName]!"
 flavor_hun.48.b:0 "It is wiser to move the court to [1772.GetName]"
 flavor_hun.49.t:0 "Juraj Jánosík"
 flavor_hun.49.d:0 "The infamous bandit Juraj Jánosík and his group have been terrorizing the nobles and burghers of Upper Bosnia. Their audacious raids have caused a great deal of distress and disruption, and it seems to be nearly impossible to track him and his group down since they share a portion of their loot with local peasants who then in turn protect them from the authorities. He is slowly becoming a hero of the local Slovak folk, and his group is rapidly growing in size, as many, even from Poland and Moravia, are joining his ranks. The estates, unable to handle the situation on their own, have come to us with complaints and pleas for aid. They are requesting the Crown's intervention to track down Jánosík and bring him to justice."
 flavor_hun.49.a:0 "Organize a group to hunt him down"
 flavor_hun.49.b:0 "Hungarian estates cannot deal with one bandit?"
 flavor_hun.50.t:0 "Jánosík Strikes Again"
 flavor_hun.50.d:0 "Ignoring the pleas of the Estates has led to dire consequences - Juraj Jánosík and his band have struck again, this time with even more audacity and ferocity. The estates are enraged and the people live in fear. The crown can no longer turn a blind eye to Jánosík's terror."
 flavor_hun.50.a:0 "Mobilize the troops!"
 flavor_hun.51.t:0 "The End of Jánosík"
 flavor_hun.51.d:1 "Thanks to our efforts, the infamous bandit Juraj Jánosík and most of his group have finally been caught and brought to justice. Following a trial in Liptószentmiklós, Jánosík was sentenced to death. Although we have failed to catch some other members of his group, it is safe to assume that without Jánosík's leadership, the bandits will disintegrate and cease their actions. The estates are finally relieved, and peace has been restored in Upper Bosnia."
 flavor_hun.51.a:0 "May his end be a warning to all"
 hun_end_of_banditry:0 "End of Banditry"
 desc_hun_end_of_banditry:0 "Following the execution of Juraj Jánosík, the banditry in Upper Bosnia has stopped and both the estates and locals are relieved."
 flavor_hun.53.t:0 "The Production Focus in [140.GetName]"
 flavor_hun.53.d:0 "Our new investments in the development of [140.GetName] have paid off, as the city continues to gain wealth and size, we now have the ability to look towards the future. Even now many question if we should use our newfound production capabilities to focus on producing different kinds of trade goods in our capital. Perhaps we should look to producing goods that will stand a better chance of generating profit in the future. Many have been suggesting to focus on the processing of raw material imported from the mines of Upper Bosnia and Transylvania, while others wish to establish new manufactories for the production of cloth or glass, that would rival even the famed Bohemian and Venetian works. What shall we do?"
 flavor_hun.53.a:0 "Let us invest in the cloth industry"
 flavor_hun.53.b:0 "Copper is a vital trade good for many things"
 flavor_hun.53.c:0 "We shall process the raw materials from our mining cities"
 flavor_hun.53.de:0 "Our glass will rival that of Bohemia and Venice"
 flavor_hun.53.e:0 "The current focus works well for us"
